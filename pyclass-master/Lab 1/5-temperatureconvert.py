# Write a program that prompts the user to input a Celsius temperature
# and outputs the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula to
# convert the temperature is: F = 9/5 C + 32 where F is the Fahrenheit
# temperature and C is the Celsius temperature.


celc = float(input("Please enter temperature in Celcius: "))

fren = (9/5)*celc+32

print("Temperature in Farenheit: ", fren)
